/// The world-touching calls are sim-scoped: legal wherever a `SimCtx` is
/// published (`mod_init`, tick systems, event handlers), [`HostRet::Error`]
/// outside any guest dispatch.
///
/// # Item identity
///
/// Items have ONE mod-facing identity: the registry NAME (`"petramond:coal"`,
/// `"farming:wheat"` — the `item` field of an `items.json` row). Every
/// name-addressed call speaks it, and [`ItemStackData`] carries it. The
/// numeric [`ItemId`] is a session-scoped compact form for id-bearing
/// payloads (events, [`HostCall::ConsumeHeld`]); bridge the two with
/// [`HostCall::ResolveItem`] (name → id) and [`HostCall::ItemNames`]
/// (id → name), and never persist numeric ids. The `key` field on
/// `items.json` rows is engine-internal recipe plumbing and does not cross
/// the ABI.
///
/// # Mob addressing
///
/// A LIVE mob has ONE address: its stable session id
/// ([`MobSnapshot::id`], the `mob_id` field on every mob call and event
/// payload). It survives unrelated removals and is the key for cross-tick
/// mod state; the list `index` on [`MobSnapshot`] is only an intra-tick
/// join key between snapshots and is accepted by no call. Dead
/// (ragdolling) mobs are GONE to this surface — id-addressed reads answer
/// `None`, writes answer `false`, exactly the live set
/// [`HostCall::MobsInRadius`] enumerates. Mob SPECIES are keyed by their
/// `mobs.json` `key` string (`"petramond:sheep"`); the numeric [`MobId`]
/// is its session-scoped compact form in payloads — bridge with
/// [`HostCall::ResolveMob`] (key → id) and [`HostCall::MobNames`]
/// (id → key), and never persist either the numeric species id or a live
/// mob's session id.
///
/// # Player addressing
///
/// Every call or payload field that names a player carries the
/// [`PlayerId`] newtype EXPLICITLY ([`HostCall::PlayerInput`],
/// [`HostCall::MobMount`], [`HostCall::ChatSend`] targets, event payloads
/// like `MobInteract`/`PlayerDismounted`). This is the frozen rule for NEW
/// surface: a player-touching call takes a `player_id` — never a bare `u8`,
/// and never a new implicit-player call. The older single-player-era calls
/// ([`HostCall::PlayerState`], [`HostCall::DamagePlayer`],
/// [`HostCall::GiveItem`], [`HostCall::Teleport`], ...) address the ACTING
/// session's player as a documented default — the session whose dispatch is
/// running (the interacting player for event handlers, the host session for
/// global tick systems). They are the legacy exception, not the pattern;
/// their per-player reshape is pending, and enumerating sessions is already
/// explicit via [`HostCall::Players`].
///
/// # Batch bounds
///
/// Batched sim/registry calls (`GetBlocks`, `SetBlocks`, `ContainerGetMany`,
/// `ContainerSet` slots, the `*Names` reverse resolvers, `ChatSend` targets)
/// are capped at 4096 entries per call. Exceeding the cap is
/// [`HostRet::Error`] (SDK panic → mod disabled): a batch that size is a mod
/// bug, and the watchdog deliberately does not charge host-side work — the

/// carry their own (tighter, per-frame) documented caps.
