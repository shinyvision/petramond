//! Per-block behaviour — a block's "class".
//!
//! Every block's data row ([`BlockDef`](super::definition::BlockDef)) points at
//! one `&'static dyn BlockBehavior`. Everything a block *does* (as opposed to what
//! it *is* — categorised by [`BlockTag`](super::BlockTag)) lives behind this
//! trait, so giving a block reactive behaviour is "write a behaviour, point its
//! row at it" — never a new `match` arm in the simulation. Most blocks use
//! [`INERT`] (every method defaulted); a block overrides only the hooks it needs.
//!
//! **One behaviour per file.** Each behaviour lives in its own module here and
//! re-exports its singleton below, so rows still read `behavior::LEAVES` while
//! `mod.rs` carries only the shared trait and the registry of behaviours. Adding
//! one is: add a file, add its `mod` + `pub use` line here, point the row at it.
//!
//! Behaviours act on the world through its PUBLIC api only — they never reach into
//! its internals — so a behaviour needing no privileged access (leaf decay) lives
//! here in `block`, while one that does (fluid flow, which drives the world
//! scheduler) can live in `world` and still implement this `block`-defined trait.
