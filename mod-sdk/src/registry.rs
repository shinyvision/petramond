//! Registry queries: name↔id resolution, tag membership, and item row
//! reads. Everything here is registry-only — legal on ANY instance (server,
//! worldgen, client), any time — and session-stable: resolve once in
//! [`Mod::init`] and keep the result in mod state, but NEVER persist numeric
//! ids (names are the stable identity).
//!
//! Items have ONE mod-facing identity, the registry NAME (`"petramond:coal"`,
//! `"farming:wheat"`); [`ItemId`]s in event payloads bridge to it through
//! [`resolve_item`] / [`item_names`].
